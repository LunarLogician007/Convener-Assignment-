## Theo Jansen Mechanism – Leg Modeling Task

Did you know that while most robotic legs use two or more actuators, it is possible to replicate a walking motion using just a single motor? This is made possible by the **Theo Jansen Mechanism**, which cleverly transforms simple rotational motion into a natural walking gait. Despite its elegance, the mechanism is not overly complex and is well-suited for mechanical modeling.

Your task is to model the walking motion of a leg using the Theo Jansen Mechanism in any CAD software of your choice. We recommend using **SolidWorks** for this task.

### Submission Guidelines

Please submit the following:

- **CAD files** of your modeled leg mechanism (SolidWorks files or compatible formats).
- **A short video** demonstrating the movement of the mechanism, showcasing the walking motion generated by the Theo Jansen linkage.

Ensure that the video clearly displays the motion and rotation input driving the mechanism.
